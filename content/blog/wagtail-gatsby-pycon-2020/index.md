Welcome, this blog is where I'll post content regarding django, wagtail, tech and the intersections that I care about. Introductions are difficult, but with time we'll ease into this blogger / reader relationship nicely. With practice, we'll both learn a lot.

As I gather the courage to publish my thoughts and tutorials on the technologies I use, interviews with people I respect, and reviews of events I have the pleasure of attending, feel free to catch me in the twittersphere.
