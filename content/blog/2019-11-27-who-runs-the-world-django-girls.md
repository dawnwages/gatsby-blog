It was an amazing experience to organize my first Django Girls after being brought into the django community through Django Girls in 2016. A full, free event that guides you through creating and deploying a personal blog using HTML, CSS, Python, Django and covering concepts:

- Querying a database
- Template creation, inheritance and management
- Forms
- Django ORM
- understanding your database
- command line
- server requests / how the internet works
- virtual environments
- ... and more!
