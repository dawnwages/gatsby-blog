title: Coding Challenges

  I hate coding challenges. I'm morally opposed to being tested on things that
  don't directly translate to practical day to day skills. There is no fool
  proof way to vet a candidate to make sure they're able to perform the first
  day on the job -- nor should there be. You're investing in the capabilities of
  a *human* not a bot that churns out code to your feature specifications.
  You're hiring them for their experience and aptitude. 


  In rare occasions there are jobs that attempt to simulate what you'll do day
  to day, distilled into a few hours; and in every case I've heard think they're
  unrealistic and inaccessible.


  What ends up happening is you're rejecting great candidates who don't have
  time to practice coding challenges in the same fashion one would study for the
  GRE, SAT or another standardized test. Hiring managers have no idea what
  they're doing and it shows.


  *sigh* while I'm coordinating lining up every Engineering HR department to do
  a cartoonish row of slaps all the way down the line, I practice some coding
  exercises and try not to take it personally that the industry was not made for
  me. I'm finally at a point in my career where I can afford to spend my extra
  time on things that don't directly relate to revenue generation.
