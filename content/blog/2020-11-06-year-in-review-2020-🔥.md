2019, I toured Europe for the majority of the year â€” some in Amsterdam, a little in London. I, an optimistic and ambitious new consultant, decided my first year as a full time consultant should be taking advantage of the remote work with her 6 year old beagle in tow.

Iâ€™d be remiss to discuss both 2019 or 2020 if I didnâ€™t discus how my career has evolved along with my focus on my mental health. The move to Europe was a calculated one that began after a break up mid 2018, that should have broke my heart, but only broke my will. There were no tears, there was just this odd, empty end of interesting possibilities â€” insert obscure Steven Universe reference about Garnetâ€™s future vision. I planned and planned and what was supposed to be Paris with my first big software engineer break, after teaching myself to code for the previous four years, but ended up being consulting and betting on myself since no one else would take a chance on this black girl. 

## I leaned on my community...

I made an excellent bet and havenâ€™t looked back. I went from living out of a few suitcases with my dog 2,000+ miles away from anyone I loved in 2019 to 2020: Iâ€™ve traded Euro cafÃ©s with my first dedicated home office (with a door!), a true community with a big brother, [Tim Allen](https://glittertech.dev), a new interdisciplinary [brain trust](https://glittertech.dev/braintrust) ðŸ§  of my favorite qpoc (we affectionately call ourselves the South Philly Queers on Wheels as weâ€™ve all head out skatepark friend dated with boards and quad skates), partnering with my sister [Brooke Wages](https://glittertech.dev) as a technical liaison for a [TBA Black Entrepreur Confrence at MIT](https://glittertech.dev), and being just a month shy of an anniversary with a new team Two Rock Software, founded by two of the most encouraging and fun developers Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working beside â€” it makes sense that I was introduced by one of the most straight-shooter, pragmatic, bright and kind people Iâ€™ve met Erin Mullaney.

When the going got tough, the tough got going...



A lot of you may be first introduced to me through [this not-so-viral tweet](https://twitter.com/ve4tm/status/1321641275704152064?s=21), that inspired a lot of action. From it I created [Volunteer Engineers 4 The Movement](https://ve4tm.dev), a collective of black tech professionals developing applications for good. We organized around 20+ projects and leverage each other as a resource in teams and ideas. The flat, no hierarchical, decentralized structure allows it to be a community of self-motivated individuals rather than a movement propelled by ego. 

## Antiracist code

June was a tough f*cking month. I was paralyzed. On top of the pandemic, the community I desperately missed and informed my move back to the United States, and Philly in particular, was having another reckoning. Tensions rose and people were dying. I saw videos of angry South Philly white men stomping through streets I recognized and I boarded up at home â€” telling me that my people simply asking to not be murdered in the street was an affront to them personally. I saw thousands, inspired and afraid and sad, coming forward with their trauma, hoping another anecdote will humanize the already well known statistics: at every level, at every interaction with the system we are confronted with racism both codified  this, I was motivated to put into action my passion project: At The Root
