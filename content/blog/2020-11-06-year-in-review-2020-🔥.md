2019, I toured Europe for the majority of the year â€” some in Amsterdam, a little in London. I, an optimistic and ambitious new consultant, decided my first year as a full time consultant should be taking advantage of the remote work with her 6 year old beagle in tow.

Iâ€™d be remiss to discuss both 2019 or 2020 if I didnâ€™t discus how my career has evolved along with my focus on my mental health. The move to Europe was a calculated one that began after a break up mid 2018, that should have broke my heart, but only broke my will. There were no tears, there was just this odd, empty end of interesting possibilities â€” insert obscure Steven Universe reference about Garnetâ€™s future vision. I planned and planned and what was supposed to be Paris with my first big software engineer break, after teaching myself to code for the previous four years, but ended up being consulting and betting on myself since no one else would take a chance on this black girl. 

I made an excellent bet and havenâ€™t looked back. I went from living out of a few suitcases with my dog 2,000+ miles away from anyone I loved in 2019 to 2020: Iâ€™ve traded Euro cafÃ©s with my first dedicated home office (with a door!), a true community with a big brother, [Tim Allen](https://glittertech.dev), a new interdisciplinary [brain trust](https://glittertech.dev/braintrust) ðŸ§  of my favorite qpoc (we affectionately call ourselves the South Philly Queers on Wheels as weâ€™ve all head out skatepark friend dated with boards and quad skates), partnering with my sister [Brooke Wages](https://glittertech.dev) as a technical liaison for a [TBA Black Entrepreur Confrence at MIT](https://glittertech.dev), and being just a month shy of an anniversary with a new team Two Rock Software, founded by two of the most encouraging and fun developers Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working beside â€” it makes sense that I was introduced by one of the most straight-shooter, pragmatic, bright and kind people Iâ€™ve met Erin Mellaney.
