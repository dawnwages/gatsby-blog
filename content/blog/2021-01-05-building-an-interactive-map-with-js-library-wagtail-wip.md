title: Building an Interactive Map with JS Library & Wagtail (WIP)
date: 2000-01-05T23:21:00.000Z
description: The point of this tutorial is to show how Wagtail snippets work and
  we have the added complicated bonus of using a paid JS Library on top. I'll go
  over very quickly what the JS Library can do, but I'll talk to you how we used
  Wagtail snippets to allow our clients to update the map.
